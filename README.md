# Discrption - During my internship, I developed a Temperature Monitoring System designed to continuously measure and display the ambient temperature using a microcontroller and a digital temperature sensor. The main objective was to create a system that could track real-time temperature data and display it either on an LCD screen or send it via serial communication to a connected device such as a computer or smartphone.

The system uses a sensor like the LM35, DHT11, or DS18B20 to capture temperature data. The sensor output is processed by an Arduino UNO, which converts the analog/digital signal into a readable temperature value in Celsius or Fahrenheit. This value is then displayed on a 16x2 LCD or printed on the Serial Monitor.
